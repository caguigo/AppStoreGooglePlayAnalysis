# App Store and Google Play Analysis

Analysis of which free apps would the most profitable for a company whose main area of business is developing free apps. This fictional company, Acme Inc, has a business model based on collecting revenue from ads in apps and freemium features. 

This project contains:
- Initial observation of both databases, which together contain over 18000 rows
- Data cleaning - duplicates, unreadable characters and symbols
- Profitability analysis. Specifically on the ratio of free app availability / downloads for each genre in the App Store and Google Play Store. 

Described the process step by step aiming the analysis to Director and above level executives that might not have the technical knowledge to understand the code but that need this strategic data to keep the business growing. At the end of the project, I draw my conclusions and give a sample of the best apps in each store for the development team to have a starting point.
